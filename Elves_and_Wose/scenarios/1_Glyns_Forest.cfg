As he set out to pay tribute to his old friend, he reflected that Delfador had lived a long and successful life, while contributing a great service to the humans of Wesnoth. Without him, both Wesnoth and Wesmere would have surely fallen to the evil Queen Asheviere. Yes, Delfador's passing caused Kalenz great sadness."
