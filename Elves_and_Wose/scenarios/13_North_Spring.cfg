        message= _ "Four centuries ago, the Aragwaith lived in the territory ranging from Weldyn to the North Lands. Legend has it that a Sorcerer named Morlock betrayed the elves of the land now called Weldyn, where the forest of Welnaught once existed. Morlock gained the trust of everyone by killing off invading saurians with powerful magic, and quickly became a charismatic local hero. One day, Morlock offered the elves an opportunity to learn the secrets of Aragwaith magic. He prepared a potion and instructed everyone in the forest to wait until the first hour of the new year to consume the potion. When they awoke, he promised, they would all possess his powers."

Screeches were heard across the forest throughout the night. Morlock looked on in elated joy. He watched as a new race was born: the Orcs. "

        speaker=Saleh
        message= _ "Oh, okay, I am remembering the story from my youth now. The Curse of Morlock, I think it is called. But I thought that was all fantasy. The orcs really are born from fallen elves?"
    [/message]

    [message]
        speaker=Chantal
        message= _ "I am afraid it is true. Morlock created the orcs because he needed an army that he could control. He was not content to be a small time hero that wasted his talents frying saurians in swamps. No, he had bigger aspirations. In fact, he had an insatiable hunger for absolute power that led him to wage war on all of Wesnoth's races. He had in his possession an artifact of great power that drove him to act this way. Need I say what it is? (The Ruby)"
    [/message]

    [message]
        speaker=Chantal
        message= _ "So, Morlock waged war. The first move he made was to burn Welnaught Forest to the ground. That move alone eliminated an entire civilization of Wose, in addition to the murder of countless other races and species. Then, he marched west to the city now known as Dan Tonk to build a castle, from which he could launch attacks."
    [/message]

    [message]
        speaker=Chantal
        message= _ "To make a long story short. The horrors that Morlock brought on this land generated a very negative backlash. Trolls, Dwarves, Elves, and many other races turned on the Aragwaith, burning their homes and killing any in sight. Though they were unfairly persecuted, they were held responsible for Morlock's actions. In the end, the Aragwaith were excommunicated, and told never to return. The betrayal of the elves, and the birth of the orcs is a scourge on the history of Wesnoth, and we are still seeing the results of it today."

    [message]
